Python program in development as a practice tool for Texas hold 'em.

Intended functionality is for the user to present the program with a board state, of either 0, 3, 4, or 5 cards out, to which the program will return some of the top potential hole cards that you or your opponent could be holding and where they rank against each other. 

For example if you input into the program that the board is Ace of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, Queen of Diamonds then the program will return a few hands with the one at the top being the best potential hand of Jack of Diamonds & 10 of Diamonds (resulting in royal flush, the best hand in poker).
